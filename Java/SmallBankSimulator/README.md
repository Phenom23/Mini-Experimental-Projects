Just a program to try and compose all the new knowledge i recently got learning java se. 
I wanted to demonstrate the manipulation of  data in Lists/Queues, file write and read, exception handling and overall oragnisation of my project to packages, classes etc.

It is a bank simulator, and it has a simulation mode which tries to mimic real life crisis inside banks haha!
To be honest, besides showcasing my new knowledge and getting trained on applying it, there is not an apparent practial application of this program..but oh well!

More features to be implemented as time's goes by
