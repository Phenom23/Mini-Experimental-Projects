# SmallBankSimulator 



Just a program to try and compose all the new knowledge i recently got learning java se. <br><br>

>I wanted to demonstrate the manipulation of  data in Lists/Queues/Sets, file write and read, exception handling, enums and overall oragnisation of my project to packages, classes (i may have failed doing it right, but i tried!) etc.
To be honest, besides showcasing my new knowledge and getting trained on applying it, there is not an apparent practial application of this program..but oh well!

## Features

- Create multiple cashiers, add or serve customers per cashier with a priority set to each customer. The distrubution of the customers is done in a balancing way.
- A simulation mode, in which you set the percentages of possibility that a customer will be served, or will come, and the amount of iterations (actions) per simulation.
- Save the state of the queues and restore them.
- The ability to enter to an atm, by creating an atm account first (OR signing in), and to withdraw/deposit or transfer money to another atm customer.
- The ability, by entering a STUFF ONLY option (you have to type a "special code" in order to have access to it) to see all the atm customers, their balance and their passkeys

There was a a big focous on  safety, so every step, with every possible user action, will not result to a program malfunction or crash. In addition, even though it's a terminal based program, in almost every step, i provide an exit to the previous state, just like a gui one (it's a terminal program because my focous was purely on functionality and training my java se skills, not the aesthetics on this one).

_More features to be implemented as time's goes by (maybe)_
